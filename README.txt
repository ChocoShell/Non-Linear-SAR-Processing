1. Finish Matlab Code                                               | Done
2. Add CUDA notes to Matlab code for code audit.                    | Done

3. Test cuFFT to see how it works.
    - Make sure FFT on sRaw and ifft on sRaw return the same result | Later

4. CUDA stuff:
    - fftshift  - Needs to be implemented, need to sync threads     | Done
    - fftshift2 - Shift rows and columns                            | Done
    - Array-Vector By element Multiplier needs to be tested         | Done+
    - Constant-Vector Multiplier                                    | Done+
    - Cuda math functions                                           | 
    - Matrix-Matrix Multiplication for two arrays -> Implement      | 
    - Sinc function for spatial interpolate                         | Later
    - Matrix Transpose                                              | Done
