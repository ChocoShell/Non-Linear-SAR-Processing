1. Finish Matlab Code                                               | Done
2. Add CUDA notes to Matlab code for code audit.                    | Done
3. Test cuFFT to see how it works.
    - Make sure FFT on sRaw and ifft on sRaw return the same result |
4. CUDA stuff:
    - fftshift  - Needs to be implemented, need to sync threads     |
    - fftshift2 - Shift rows and columns                            |
    - Array Vector Multiplier needs to be tested                    |
    - Cuda math functions                                           |
    - Matrix-Matrix Multiplication for two arrays -> Implement      |
    - Sinc function for spatial interpolate                         |
    - Matrix Transpose                                              | Done
5. Outline differences between Matlab code and paper                |
6. List differences:
